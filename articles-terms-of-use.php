        <h4 id="terms">1. Accepting These Terms</h4>
        <note>This document and the other documents that we reference below make up our house rules, or what we officially call our Terms of Use (the “Terms” for short).
            The Terms are a legally binding contract between you and ToniaStore. If you live in North America or South America, the contract is between you and ToniaStore, Inc.; if you live elsewhere, the contract is between you and ToniaStore Ireland UC, a subsidiary of ToniaStore, Inc. We’ll just refer to ToniaStore, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries collectively as “ToniaStore.”
            This contract sets out your rights and responsibilities when you use ToniaStore.com, Pattern by ToniaStore, our mobile apps, and the other services provided by ToniaStore (we’ll refer to all of these collectively as our “Services”), so please read it carefully. By using any of our Services (even just browsing one of our websites), you’re agreeing to the Terms. If you don’t agree with the Terms, you may not use our Services. You with us? Great, read on!
        </note><br>
        <h4 id="privacy">2. Your Privacy</h4>
        <note>We know your personal information is important to you, so it’s important to us. Our Privacy Policy details how your information is used when you use our Services. By using our Services, you're also agreeing that we can process your information in the ways set out in the Privacy Policy, so please read it here.
            Both ToniaStore and sellers process members’ personal information (for example, buyer name, email address, and shipping address) and are therefore considered separate and independent data controllers of buyers’ personal information under EU law. That means that each party is responsible for the personal information it processes in providing the Services. For example, if a seller accidentally discloses a buyer’s name and email address when fulfilling another buyer’s order, the seller, not ToniaStore, will be responsible for that unauthorized disclosure.  
            If, however, ToniaStore and sellers are found to be joint data controllers of buyers’ personal information, and if ToniaStore is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did as a joint data controller of buyer personal information, you agree to indemnify ToniaStore for the expenses it occurs in connection with your processing of buyer personal information.
        </note><br>
        <h4 id="account">3. Your Account with Etsy</h4>
        <note>You’ll need to create an account with ToniaStore to use some of our Services. Here are a few rules about accounts with ToniaStore:
            A. You must be 18 years or older to use our Services. Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our Services through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission and under their direct supervision. Children under 13 years are not permitted to use ToniaStore or the Services. You are responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor on your account. 
            B. Be honest with us. Provide accurate information about yourself. It’s prohibited to use false information or impersonate another person or company through your account.
            C. Choose an appropriate name. If you decide to not have your full name serve as the name associated with your account, you may not use language that is offensive, vulgar, infringes someone’s intellectual property rights, or otherwise violates the Terms.
            D. You're responsible for your account. You’re solely responsible for any activity on your account. If you’re sharing an account with other people, then the person whose financial information is on the account will ultimately be responsible for all activity. If you’re registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of the business. Also, your accounts are not transferable.
            E. Protect your password. As we mentioned above, you’re solely responsible for any activity on your account, so it’s important to keep your account password secure. 
            F. Let's be clear about our relationship. These Terms don't create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or franchisee relationship between you and ToniaStore.
        </note><br>
        <h4 id="services">4. Use of Our Services</h4>
        <note>License to Use Our Services. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use our Services—subject to the Terms and the following restrictions in particular:

            A. Don’t Use Our Services to Break the Law. You agree that you will not violate any laws in connection with your use of the Services. This includes any local, state, federal, and international laws that may apply to you. For example, it’s your responsibility to obtain any permits or licenses that your shop requires; you may not sell anything that violates any laws; you must comply with our Sanctions Policy, and you may not engage in fraud (including false claims or infringement notices), theft, anti-competitive conduct, threatening conduct, or any other unlawful acts or crimes against ToniaStore, another ToniaStore user, or a third party.
            <br>
            B. Pay Your Bills. You are responsible for paying all fees that you owe to ToniaStore. Except as set forth below, you are also solely responsible for collecting and/or paying any applicable taxes for any purchases or sales you make through our Services. In addition, ToniaStore will calculate, collect, and remit sales tax where applicable. Please see this FAQ for more information. Your fees, bills, taxes, and how you can pay them are fully explained in our Fees & Payments Policy.
            <br>
            C. Don’t Steal Our Stuff. You agree not to crawl, scrape, or spider any page of the Services or to reverse engineer or attempt to obtain the source code of the Services. If you want to use our API, please follow our API Terms of Use.
            <br>
            D. Don’t Try to Harm Our Systems. You agree not to interfere with or try to disrupt our Services, for example by distributing a virus or other harmful computer code.
            <br>
            E. Follow Our Trademark Policy. The name "ToniaStore" and the other ToniaStore marks, phrases, logos, and designs that we use in connection with our Services, are trademarks, service marks, or trade dress of ToniaStore in the US and other countries. 
            <br>
            F. Share Your Ideas. We love your suggestions and ideas! They can help us improve your experience and our Services. Any unsolicited ideas or other materials you submit to ToniaStore (not including Your Content or items you sell through our Services) are considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.
            <br>
            G. Talk to Us Online. From time to time, ToniaStore will provide you with certain legal information in writing. By using our Services, you’re agreeing to our Electronic Communications Policy, which describes how we provide that information to you. It says that we can send you information electronically (such as by email) instead of mailing you paper copies (it’s better for the environment), and that your electronic agreement is the same as your signature on paper.
        </note><br>
        <h4 id="warranties">5. Warranties and Limitation of Liability (or the Things You Can’t Sue Us For)</h4>
        <note>Items You Purchase. You understand that ToniaStore does not manufacture, store, or inspect any of the items sold through our Services. We provide the venue; the items in our marketplaces are produced, listed, and sold directly by independent sellers, so ToniaStore cannot and does not make any warranties about their quality, safety, or even their legality. Any legal claim related to an item you purchase must be brought directly against the seller of the item. You release ToniaStore from any claims related to items sold through our Services, including for defective items, misrepresentations by sellers, or items that caused physical injury (like product liability claims).
            Content You Access. You may come across materials that you find offensive or inappropriate while using our Services. We make no representations concerning any content posted by users through the Services. ToniaStore is not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of content posted by users that you accessed through the Services. You release us from all liability relating to that content.<br>
            People You Interact With. You can use the Services to interact with other individuals, either online or in person. However, you understand that we do not screen users of our Services, and you release us from all liability relating to your interactions with other users. Please be careful and exercise caution and good judgment in all interactions with others, especially if you are meeting someone in person. This Help article has some good advice about handling in person meetings.<br>
            Third-Party Services. Our Services may contain links to third-party websites or services that we don’t own or control (for example, links to Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest). You may also need to use a third party’s product or service in order to use some of our Services (like a compatible mobile device to use our mobile apps). When you access these third-party services, you do so at your own risk. The third parties may require you to accept their own terms of use. ToniaStore is not a party to those agreements; they are solely between you and the third party.<br>
            Gift Cards and Promotions. You acknowledge that ToniaStore does not make any warranties with respect to your Gift Card balance and is not responsible for any unauthorized access to, or alteration, theft, or destruction of a Gift Card or Gift Card code that results from any action by you or a third party. You also acknowledge that we may suspend or prohibit use of your Gift Card if your Gift Card or Gift Card code has been reported lost or stolen, or if we believe your Gift Card balance is being used suspiciously, fraudulently, or in an otherwise unauthorized manner. If your Gift Card code stops working, your only remedy is for us to issue you a replacement Gift Card code. By participating in a special offer or promotion, you agree that you may not later claim that the rules of that special offer or promotion were ambiguous.

        <h4 id="indemnification">6. Indemnification (or What Happens If You Get Us Sued)</h4>
        <note>
            We hope this never happens, but if ToniaStore gets sued because of something that you did, you agree to defend and indemnify us. That means you’ll defend ToniaStore (including any of our employees) and hold us harmless from any legal claim or demand (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that arises from your actions, your use (or misuse) of our Services, your breach of the Terms, or your account’s infringement of someone else’s rights.<br><br>
            We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see fit, even if you are indemnifying us, in which case you agree to cooperate with us so we can execute our strategy.

        <h4 id="legal">8. Some Finer Legal Points</h4>
        <note>The Terms, including all of the policies that make up the Terms, supersede any other agreement between you and ToniaStore regarding the Services. If any part of the Terms is found to be unenforceable, that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any part of the Terms is not a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of the Terms. We may assign any of our rights and obligations under the Terms.
